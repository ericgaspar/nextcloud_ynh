## Configuration

#### Configure OnlyOffice integration

Starting from Nextcloud 18, it features a direct integration of OnlyOffice (an online rich text document editor) through a Nextcloud app.
To install and configure it:
- Install *Community Document Server* application in your Nextcloud. That's the part that runs OnlyOffice server.
- Install *ONLYOFFICE* application. That's the client part that will connect to an OnlyOffice server.
- Then in Settings -> ONLYOFFICE (`https://yourdomain.tld/nextcloud/settings/admin/onlyoffice`), if you want to configure which file formats should be opened by OnlyOffice.
- Here you go :) You should be able to create new type of documents and open them.

*NB: OnlyOffice is only available for x86 architecture - **ARM** architecture is **not** supported (Raspberry Pi, OLinuXino...)*

## YunoHost specific features

In addition to Nextcloud core features, the following are made available with
this package:

 * Integrate with YunoHost users and SSO - i.e. logout button
 * Allow one user to be the administrator (set at the installation)
 * Allow multiple instances of this application
 * Optionally access the user home folder from Nextcloud files (set at the installation, the sharing is enabled by default)
 * Serve `/.well-known` paths for CalDAV and CardDAV on the domain only if it's not already served - i.e. by Baïkal

#### Multi-users support

#### Supported architectures

* x86-64 - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/logs/nextcloud%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/nextcloud/)
* ARMv8-A - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/logs/nextcloud%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/apps/nextcloud/)

## Limitations

To integrate the logout button to the SSO, we have to patch Nextcloud sources. In waiting an upstream integration, the source code integrity checking has been disabled to prevent the warning message.

Also, note we made the choice to disable third-parties applications at the upgrade. It allows to prevent an unstable - and sometimes broken - Nextcloud installation. You will just have to manually activate them after the upgrade.

Finally, the following error message in Nextcloud logs can be safely ignored:
```
Following symlinks is not allowed ('/home/yunohost.multimedia/user/Share' -> '/home/yunohost.multimedia/share/' not inside '/home/yunohost.multimedia/user/')
```

## Additionnal informations

#### `occ` command usage

If you need/want to use Nextcloud `occ` command¹, you need to be in `/var/www/nextcloud/` folder (or `/var/www/nextcloud__n/` depending on your instance number in case of multiple concurrent installations), then use `sudo -u nextcloud php7.3 occ` instead of `occ` (as an alternative, you can use `/var/www/nextcloud/occ` to run the command from another directory).

*NB: You may need to adapt `php7.3` to the PHP version that Nextcloud is using. Starting from Nextcloud 18, YunoHost uses php7.3, it used before php7.0.*

¹ See https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/18/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html
 Use this only if you know what you're doing :)
